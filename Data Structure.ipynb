Any operation that seems to modify a string actually creates a new string object.\n","\n","Reasons Why Strings Are Immutable:\n","1. Security and Data Integrity\n","Strings are widely used as identifiers (e.g., keys in dictionaries, file paths, etc.).\n","\n","Immutability ensures they remain unchanged, avoiding bugs caused by accidental modification.\n","\n","2. Hashability\n","Only immutable objects can be hashed, which is required for use as dictionary keys or set elements.\n","\n","Since strings are immutable, they can be hashed safely and consistently.\n","\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","my_dict = {\"username\": \"alice\"}\n","# This only works because \"username\" is immutable and hashable\n","3. Performance Optimization\n","Python uses string interning (reusing identical immutable strings in memory).\n","\n","This saves memory and speeds up comparisons (== is faster when two strings point to the same object).\n","\n","4. Thread Safety\n","Immutable objects are naturally thread-safe—they can be shared across threads without risk of one thread modifying the object for others.\n","\n","Example:\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","s = \"hello\"\n","s = s + \" world\"  # A new string is created, original \"hello\" remains unchanged\n","\n","Q 11 What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","\n","Dictionaries offer several key advantages over lists for certain tasks in Python, especially when fast access and associative relationships are important.\n","\n","Dictionaries vs Lists — When and Why to Use a Dictionary\n","\n","Feature\tDictionary (dict)\t                  List (list)\n","\n","Access by\t         Key\t                    Index\n","\n","Lookup Speed\t     Very fast (O(1) average)\tSlower (O(n) for search)\n","\n","Associates keys to values\tYes\t  No (just ordered values)\n","\n","Key-value pairing\t Ideal for structured data\tMust manage structure manually\n","\n","Uniqueness of keys\tKeys must be unique\t Duplicates allowed\n","\n","Order preservation\tYes (as of Python 3.7+)\t Yes\n","\n","Advantages of Dictionaries Over Lists:\n","\n","1.

Here's a breakdown of when and why you might choose a list instead of a dictionary:\n","\n","When to Prefer Lists Over Dictionaries\n","Situation\tWhy Lists Are Better\n","1. Order matters\tLists maintain insertion order and are naturally ordered by index (0, 1, 2...), making them ideal for ordered data like queues, stacks, or sequences.\n","\n","2. You need indexed access\tAccess by position (e.g., my_list[2]) is very efficient — O(1) — and more intuitive when order is key.\n","\n","3. The data is homogeneous\tWhen storing a collection of similar items (e.g., all strings, all numbers), lists are more appropriate than key-value pairs.\n","\n","4. Memory efficiency is important\tLists are more memory-efficient than dictionaries, especially for large datasets of simple values.\n","\n","5. You’re iterating in order\tIterating over lists is faster and more natural when you need to process items in sequence.\n","\n","Example Use Cases for Lists:\n"," Example 1: Store a list of student names\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","students = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']\n","print(students[1])  # Output: Bob\n","📊 Example 2: Represent a time series of temperatures\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","temperatures = [22.5, 23.0, 21.8, 24.1]\n","average = sum(temperatures) / len(temperatures)\n","When Not to Use Lists:\n","If you need key-value relationships (e.g., mapping a name to a phone number) → use a dictionary.\n","\n","If you need fast lookups by a unique identifier → dictionary is faster (O(1) vs O(n)).\n","\n","TL;DR\n","Use lists when:\n","\n","Data is ordered and accessed by index\n","\n","Items are of the same type\n","\n","You don’t need to associate each item with a unique key\n","\n","Use dictionaries when:\n","\n","You need to associate keys with values\n","\n","You care about fast lookups by key\n","\n","Q 19 Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","\n","Why Were Dictionaries Considered Unordered?\n","Historically, before Python 3.7, dictionaries were unordered collections — meaning:\n","\n","The insertion order of keys was not guaranteed.\n","\n","Internally, the order could change, making iteration over items non-deterministic.\n","\n","This was due to the underlying hash table implementation, which focused on speed over order.\n","\n","What Changed in Python 3.7+?\n","Starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries officially preserve insertion order as part of the language specification. That means:\n","\n","Items are iterated in the order they were added.\n","\n","This change makes dictionaries more predictable and easier to work with for certain use cases.\n","\n"," Example (Python 3.7+):\n","\n","python\n","Copy\n","Edit\n","my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n","print(my_dict)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n","But important to note:\n","\n","Even though they preserve order, dictionaries are still conceptually about key-value mappings, not positions or indexes like lists.\n","\n"," How It Affects Data Retrieval\n"," What’s NOT affected:\n","Retrieving a value by key is still O(1) on average.\n","\n","You can always get my_dict['key'] quickly, regardless of order.\n","\n"," What IS affected:\n","You shouldn’t rely on key order for logic that depends on
